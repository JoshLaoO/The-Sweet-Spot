Week 3

This week I created the rest of the business endpoints in queries/routers. I protected the "create_business" endpoint.


Week 4

Created tests in test_user_business.py for business endpoints. Then I worked on a front end component for the business pending orders view. I updated the orders table to include a sold field. I downloaded the CLI for deployment. Pipeline have been set up.

Created Transaction History page. Currently the fields on Orders needs to be updated to include a sold date if we would like that displayed on this page.
