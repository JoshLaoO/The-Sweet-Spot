Week 1: Week of Jan 8, 2024
    This was the week we brainstormed our idea, came up with the concept of an e-commerce store
    with a focus on candy. We wireframed our api endpoints and what our frontend pages might look
    like. We also submtted our collaboration contract and

Week 2: Week of Jan 15, 2024
    This week we worked on creating our endpoints and tables. There was a couple of things we had
    to clean up on our wireframes as well because once we started looking into it, there were a
    some variables and some unique things we needed to have in order to not be able to create dup-
    licate users. We finished our backend authentication as well as learned a few hard lessons
    about version control with git.

Week 3: Week of Jan 22, 2024
    We finished the endpoints and tables for our backend. Though there might need to be some work
    done in joining the tables and displaying the information in a meaningful way, I think I can
    safely say we don't need to make anything new. I started to work on the unit tests on the week-
    end and got some goood progress. I just need to figure out how to get the tests to work within
    the tests folder.

Week 4: Week of Jan 29, 2024
    I worked to get the user Id to show up in the url when the customer navigates to their profile.
    It was a bit of work and research to get it to work but I solved the problems by utilizing the
    useParams function and route the userId to the url. I then worked on a view all users to get the
    contact information of all users. Eventually this will become a contact page for all users with
    businesses.

Week 5: Week of Feb 5, 2024
    This week I figured out how to conditionally render an item on the page depending whether or
    not it existed. It uses a ternary operator to check if the value exists and then returns the
    info accordingly or null. I did have some problems getting the pipeline to pass because it was
    complaining about the way I used useEffect. I removed the bracket and that seemed to do it.
