Week 1:

    Much of the project this week was tackled as a group.

    Mon - We created our MVP and stretch goals document as a group.

    Tue - We created the wireframe of what our project pages could potentially look like.
          This includes: signup, login, 6 customer pages and 5 business pages. the group
          discussed whether the business account should also have access to customer

          features.
    Wed - We created the API endpoints.

    Thu - We cleaned up the API endpoints and made them more uniform. Then worked on the
          data shape and created a mockup of what the json request and responses will
          look like.
