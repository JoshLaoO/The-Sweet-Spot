Week 1: Week of Jan 8, 2024
    This was the week we brainstormed our idea, came up with the concept of an e-commerce store

    like. We also submtted our collaboration contract and

Week 2: Week of Jan 15, 2024
    This week we worked on creating our endpoints and tables. There was a couple of things we had
    to clean up on our wireframes as well because once we started looking into it, there were a
    some variables and some unique things we needed to have in order to not be able to create dup-

    about version control with git.

Week 3: Week of Jan 22, 2024
    We finished the endpoints and tables for our backend. Though there might need to be some work
    done in joining the tables and displaying the information in a meaningful way, I think I can
    safely say we don't need to make anything new. I started to work on the unit tests on the week-
    end and got some goood progress. I just need to figure out how to get the tests to work within
    the tests folder.

Week 4: Week of Jan 29, 2024
